    "desc": "Fast Recovering from Wrong Decision Making is definitely a life-skill, coming with the need to take full responsibility. The first step you must take when having made a poor choice is to recognize the part you played in a situation. It does no good at all to make excuses or rationalize or pretend that, for whatever reason, you aren't to blame. If you want to move forward from wherever you've found yourself, you have to take responsibility for your choices and actions. Keep in mind that this is not a time to think of excuses for why it happened; this is a time to understand why it happened so you can avoid making similar decisions in the future. In this lecture, we will also learn how to apologize and explain, focus on the present and be proactive in the future.",

It's not unusual to see new managers stumble early on as they stretch beyond their previous roles. Perhaps stellar technical skills helped you get a promotion to team lead, but in a managerial role you'll be relying much more heavily on interpersonal communication skills. In this lecture, we will talk about your ability to affect change and how it is ultimately dependent on relationships and networks.",

Executives from all industries admit to being torn: How can they respond constructively to failures without giving rise to an anything-goes attitude? If people aren’t blamed for failures, what will ensure that they try as hard as possible to do their best work? Join the lecture to learn more about how to learn from others' career failures.",

The second line initialized express using the brackets which initializes an express server and puts the initialized server into the variable app. So now whenever we want to use our express server, we would need to use the app variable which represents our app!

The need to re-write the CLI tool came mostly from the fact that developers struggled with a lot of configurations while trying to setup Vue projects. There was also this push to bring about even more clarity about setting up tools at the start of any Vue project. With the new CLI version, you do not really need a full fledged project with all the configs. Sometimes, you just want to work on a single component and see it run on a local development server.
